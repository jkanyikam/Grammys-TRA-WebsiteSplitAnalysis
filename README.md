# Grammys-TRA-WebsiteSplitAnalysis

This project analyzes and measures website traffic KPIs from before and after the Grammys and The Recording Academy split their shared website into two separate websites to quantify and draw conclusions regarding the impact of their website split on user engagement.

## Data Source

This data was provided by The Global Career Accelerator's database of various companiess' data. Specifically, this data was compiled between January 2017 and May 2023.

## Analysis Methods

- Pivot Tables were used to compare the average daily website viewers on data when an award ceremony held to the average on days when no award ceremonies were held, and a line chart was added to visualize these findings.
- Pivot Tables were also created to compare the average number of pages visited by viewers per session on each website.
- Formulas were implemented to calculate KPIs such as bounce rate, pageviews, and users' average time on each site per session.

## Key Findings

- Based on the metrics quantified through cleaning and analyzing the data provided,  the Grammys and The Recording Academy websites should remain separate.
- This conclusion was reached is due to the overwhelming majority of KPIs supporting the notion that audience engagement was improved by the companies' website split.
- The positive growth across various KPIs may be due to users' interests being catered to more specifically than on the relatively broad combined website.
